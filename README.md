# RDD_quebec_covid
Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) is a method used to identify the effect of a change implemented at a cutoff point. RDD is used to estimate the effect of the following events in Quebec:

1. The 20/3/2020 lockdown
2. The reopening of schools on 31/8/2020
3. The 25/12/2020 lockdown

Covid data was scraped from online databases. The parameter used for the RDD is the daily new cases.
